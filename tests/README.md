# PriVA tests

Cluster deployment integrity: `test_cluster_deployment.py` checks atomic
publication, corruption rejection, unchanged-cache reuse, and rejection of
unidentified or modified FASTA/container resources without network or solver
operations. Real installation qualification is recorded separately by Slurm.

Updated: 2026-09-14. Existing test modules cover the workflows and data contracts
identified by their module docstrings. This inventory records the startup tests
added alongside the installer change; other upstream tests are unchanged.

| File | Purpose and dependencies | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| test_install_utils_bootstrap.py | Standard-library tests for installer startup and cache paths. The existing InstallerBootstrapTests use temporary fake managers and require fixture approval. New CachePathTests exercise defaults, custom names, old-path relocation, validation, comment-preserving writes, repeat runs, check mode, startup failure propagation and CADD selection using only memory and mocked commands/filesystem calls. Neither class downloads resources. Requires Python 3, Bash and common shell utilities. | Updated 2026-09-14; 14 focused checks passed on macOS and RHEL 8.10; based on PriVA commit 810e60165a663bd2e1223809af9f32d664a9d543. |

Run the startup suite from the repository root:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_install_utils_bootstrap.py -v
```

Run only the cache-path tests, without creating temporary fixtures:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python tests/test_install_utils_bootstrap.py CachePathTests -v
```

The full discovery command above also runs InstallerBootstrapTests, which creates
temporary files/directories; obtain fixture approval before running it.
